Hopefully you can already detect the structure of a typical ECG signal in the above graph, the repeted heart beat pattern and the prominent ECG peaks, mainly the R peaks of the signal.\n",

    "However, you might also notice that some parts are noisy or fluctuating over time. We therefore need to clean and preprocess this signal. ECG signal preprocessing typically includes the following steps, which you will implement in order:\n",

    "1. Downsampling: 700 Hz is a very high sampling frequency for ECG. The type of information we are interested in usually falls below 100 Hz.\n",
    "2. Bandpass filtering: ECG can be influenced both by low-frequency (e.g., breathing) and high-frequency noise (e.g., muscle movement, electromagnetic interference). Hence, we typically apply a bandpass filter to clean the noise. Bandpass filters come with a ``low`` and ``high`` frequency thresholds and, when applied to the signal, they discard all frequency components outside this range. Here we will use the filters of the ``scipy`` library with a low of 0.67 Hz and a high of 45 Hz.\n",
    "3. Normalization: In some cases, e.g., when we want to evaluate within-subject effects over time, we choose to normalize (or z-score) the signals at hand. In that case, the whole ECG signal is already z-scored, as you can see in the first plot. Hence we do not normalize the sample."
